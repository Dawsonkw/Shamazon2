Re imagining my original ecommerce store that I built out years ago, this time using django to build out a backend server which will hold the database for the items and the users cart. React and typescript for a frontend. Only thing coming from the original is going to be the Logo that I created, everything else is going to be new. 

Pivoted this so that it now is only going to list Electronics so that I can focus on other things instead of trying to parse through this JSON file i created for random things while every single item seems to have varios differing attributes. This will cut down on that nonsense a bit.
